'''in python variable is a container that holds data value.
 A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
 and it data type is  assign automatically based on the value you assign to it.
 it mean you do not need to declare the variable type explicitly.
 Variable names are case-sensitive, and they must start with a letter or an underscore (_), 
 followed by letters, digits, or underscores.
 Variable names cannot be the same as Python keywords (reserved words).
 Here are some examples of variable assignments in Python:
 '''
age = 20
first_Name = "omkar"
Last_Name = 'Yadav'
# class :-  {error is display here because class is a keyword in python}
is_student = True
pi = 3.14
complex_number = 2 + 3j
print(f" my name is {first_Name +" "+ Last_Name} and my age is {age}")
print(f" my name is {first_Name +" "+ Last_Name}\n my age is {age}")
